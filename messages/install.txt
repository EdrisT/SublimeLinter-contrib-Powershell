This linter plugin for SublimeLinter provides an interface to PSScriptAnalyzer.

PSScriptAnalyzer works on Windows PowerShell 3.0 or greater and PowerShell Core 6.1.0 or greater on Windows/Linux/macOS.
You can check your powershell version with `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion` from a powershell prompt.

If not already installed, install PSScriptAnalyzer with command `Install-Module -Name PSScriptAnalyzer` from a powershell prompt.

The simplest way to change the ScriptAnalyzer linter settings is from a PSScriptAnalyzer settings file.
An example settings file with commented options is located in this plugins root folder, and also shown in the end of this helpfile.
The provided example settings file checks for compatibility with powershell 3.0 and excludes the check for trailing spaces. Modify this to suite your needs.

The linter will decide which settings to use in the following order:
1. If a valid PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1 file exists in your project folder, those settings will have precedence over all other settings. This enables you to use different settings for different projects.

2.  If the powershell variable $GlobalPSScriptAnalyzerSettingsPath exists in your powershell environment and is populated with the full path to a valid settings file, those settings will be used. This enables you to use global custom settings. For persistency, set this variable in your powershell profile.

3. If no settings file is found in your project folder and the $GlobalPSScriptAnalyzerSettingsPath variable is not set, default settings of PSScriptAnalyzer will be used. (all default rules enabled and no compatibility checks)
